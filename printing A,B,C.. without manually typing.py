#A program to print all the alphabets in upper case and storing them in a list without manual typing

import string

main_upper_arr=list(string.ascii_uppercase) #For upper case alphabets
main_lower_arr=list(string.ascii_lowercase) #For lower case alphabets

for i in main_upper_arr:   #For printing in python 3.x
	print (i),
	
for i in main_upper_arr:	#For printing  in python 2.x
	print i,				
	
	
#More such examples can be included for beginners in python so that they won't waste 5 minutes on finding such stuff for school projects.
#agreed?
